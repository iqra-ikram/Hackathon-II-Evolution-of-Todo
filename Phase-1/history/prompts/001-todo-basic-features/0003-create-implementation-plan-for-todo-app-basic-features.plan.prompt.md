## Prompt

now move towards

## Response snapshot

The implementation plan for "Todo App Basic Features" is complete. The plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, and cli-interface.md have been created. The agent context (GEMINI.md) has been updated. The feature is now ready for task generation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed implementation plan, data model, and CLI contracts have been created for the Todo App Basic Features.
- 🧪 Tests: No new tests added or run.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/001-todo-basic-features/plan.md`, `specs/001-todo-basic-features/research.md`, `specs/001-todo-basic-features/data-model.md`, `specs/001-todo-basic-features/contracts/cli-interface.md`. Updated `GEMINI.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with `/sp.tasks` to generate an actionable task list for this feature.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created the implementation plan by integrating information from the specification and constitution. Properly handled the creation of `research.md`, `data-model.md`, and CLI contracts. The agent context was updated to reflect the new technical details.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

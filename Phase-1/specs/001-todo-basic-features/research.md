# Research for Todo App Basic Features

## Technology Stack Confirmation

**Decision**: Use Python 3.13+ and UV for project development and dependency management.
**Rationale**: These technologies are specified in the project constitution and are suitable for a command-line Python application. Python 3.13+ provides modern language features, and UV offers fast and reliable dependency management.
**Alternatives considered**:
*   `pip` and `venv`: Traditional Python package management, but UV offers performance benefits.
*   Other languages (e.g., Go, Rust): Not aligned with the project constitution's explicit mention of Python.

## Basic Project Setup for Python CLI

For a simple Python CLI application, a structure with a `src/` directory containing the main application logic and a `models/` subdirectory for data models is appropriate. This aligns with the "Code Quality and Structure" principle in the project constitution.
